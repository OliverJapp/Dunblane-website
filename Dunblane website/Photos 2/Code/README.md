<p>/<em>Although not neccesary i felt it better suited the website to break the content up into four pages to ensure there was appropriate amount of content</em>/</p>
<p>Let's start off with the colour scheme:</p>
<pre><code>I chose to go with a strong blue theme as the colours i associate with Dunblane since i went to high school there and the uniforms were a light blue so i tried to keep with that colour
</code></pre>
<p>banner:</p>
<pre><code>I had no issue with this part of the project
</code></pre>
<p>Layout:</p>
<pre><code>I started off using Columns and rows as i read Section E Task 9 which required us to make it compatible for all media, I structured the web-page in such a way that i feel that it looks presentable in both mobile and Pc. I read the w3schools Page on columns and rows to familiarize myself with the content. 
</code></pre>
<p>Map:</p>
<pre><code>I initially used google maps but re-read the "requirements" and it instructed us to use openstreetmap,  after clarification with Dr Robert Duncan that i could use anything as long as there was a map on the page, I reused my Google emebeded Html. I struggled with making the embeded code into a static image, but i found some relevant information on stackoverflow by Pixelomo, which disabled the mouse-cursor from interacting with the iframe
</code></pre>
<p>Images:</p>
<pre><code>I struggled finding free images of Dunblane online that were copyright free, so i asked my family to go round Dunblane and take a few photos who then allowed me to use the Photos free of charge
</code></pre>
<p>Text-content:</p>
<pre><code>Since Dunblane is such a small Community with little of notability i had to ask my family and friends from Dunblane what they considered to be important about dunblane and what tourist may want to see.
</code></pre>
<p>Nav-bar:</p>
<pre><code>I initially constructed my nav-bar in a way that made it appear the same as on Pc and on mobile but i felt it looked tacky, then my colleague showed me what they'd done and i took the idea from them and googled how to recreate it.
</code></pre>
<p>Fa-fa bar:</p>
<pre><code>On mobile to signify there are more tabs you click the fa-fa bar i struggled getting a transparent background as there were many false transparent backgrounds online i ended up using https://www.remove.bg/ to remove the background
</code></pre>
<p>Over all the project went smoothly over the 2 weeks the main and only problems being Map interactivity and Navbar mobile compatibility</p>
